		<br />Currently working on developing websites with Django. For the un-initiated, Django is a python based web-development framework. I am enjoying using it over the Flask framwork as it comes with more set-up from the start, so your website comes with many things already organised for you.  For example, an admin site is built in and a super user can be created with a simple command.

		<br />Started doing a Udemy course on python and SQL.  'The Complete Python/PostgresSQL Course 2.0'. Will come back to this course in time.  Helping me interact better with databases.

		<br />Started trying to program in C# outside of Unity in order to develop my skills in that language.  Was working on developing a hangman game when I gave it a rest for a while. Hope to come back to this game some time in the future.

		<br />Working on game development with the Unity Game Engine.  Was enjoying how quickly you can get the basics of a game working. The only downside that I found was that the coding was highly based on the API and so it seemed to be that you would learn a lot that you could only really use inside Unity (skills not very transferable).

		<br />Purchased an electronics kit for my Raspberry Pi
		<br />I bought the 'Freenove Ultimate Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi' from Amazon.  It had all sort of amazing things inside it including: a breadboard, buttons, lights, diodes, and so much more.  I had fun working through a number of the first few tutorials (which can be seen via the education link on this website).  I stopped because I saw more of a future for myself learning webdevelopment then I can see myself building electronics.  Nonetheless I would really like to keep going with this project when I have a bit more time.

		<br />I decided to do this course as I was struggling to productively use Linux, but wanted to use it for my Raspberry Pi computer that I had purchased, and in general because Linux is a free operating system that I could use on any machine.

		<br />Purchased a Raspberry Pi 4 B
		<br />I had found out that the latest model of Raspberry Pi was powerful enough to be run as it's own computer and I had to have one.  At the time most of my programming was being done on an iPad, as my kids always used my old laptop.

	<p><b>15 September 2019</b>
		<br />I made my first full stack website through this course... which was really cool. It was a website to help you track the staff retention at your workplace: <a href="https://retention-app.herokuapp.com/">The Retention Game.</a> I did however find using Flask fairly difficult, and decided that in the future I would learn Django instead in order to take my original concept and upgrade it.

	<p><b>24 May 2019</b>
		<br />This was my first full stack webdevelopment course.  I did most of the front-end half of the course but got a bit stuck when it came to using Node on the backend and didn't like using Node at that stage. Instead I decided that I wanted to jump over to using Python for backend webdevelopment. As such, I stopped completing this course and moved over to a Flask course instead.

		<br />This is the course that got me really started on my programming journey. I purchased it as I studied for my final post graduate exam... and haven't stopped learning since!

		<br />Purchased a Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+
		<br />I had heard from a random guy I was chatting with, that his son's were right into working on Raspberry Pi's.  I didn't know what they were at the time... but it sure sounded interesting.  I went and googled it and before long I had bought myself one and was learning about linux and imaging operating systems and all sorts of cool things that I had never been able to do before.

		<br />Studying Information Technology at University
		<br />Had to build a website in html for a University subject and I absolutely loved it!  This really was my first occassion to experience the joy of building something on a computer and I couldn't get enough of it!  Unfortunately as I also failed a University subject on C++ in the same year... It would take me years before I really threw myself into programming again.  The reason I failed C++ was that I had so little support to be able to understand it.  If I had all the resources available to me back then that I have now (Youtube, Udemy, good quality internet, 4G internet), I probably would have been fine.
